Website Capabilities:

Real-Time Sync: Live updates from 2+ email accounts (Gmail/Outlook).

Smart Search: Find emails instantly using keywords, senders, or AI-generated labels.

AI Automation: Auto-tag emails (e.g., "Interested") and suggest replies.

Notifications: Slack alerts for urgent emails.

Phase 1: Backend Setup & Research (3 Hours)
Objective: Lay the groundwork for email sync and AI integration.
Key Tasks:

Qroq AI Research:

Sign up for Qroq API and test its text classification endpoint.

Design a prompt to categorize emails into the 5 labels (e.g., "Interested").

Verify Qroq’s reply-generation capabilities for RAG.

Tools Setup:

Install Python, Docker, Node.js.

Initialize a FastAPI project for backend logic.

IMAP Protocol Study:

Learn how IMAP IDLE maintains persistent connections.

Phase 2: Real-Time Email Sync (5 Hours)
Objective: Fetch and store emails from 2+ accounts without manual refresh.
Tools & Purpose:

aioimaplib (Python): Handles async IMAP connections to email providers.

IMAP IDLE Mode: Listens for new emails in real-time (no cron jobs).

SQLite: Temporarily stores raw email data before Elasticsearch indexing.
Key Steps:

Configure IMAP settings (server, port, SSL) for Gmail/Outlook.

Implement logic to maintain persistent connections and auto-reconnect.

Parse emails into a structured format (sender, subject, body, date).

Phase 3: Searchable Storage with Elasticsearch (4 Hours)
Objective: Enable fast, filterable email searches.
Tools & Purpose:

Elasticsearch (Docker): Stores emails for lightning-fast queries.

Index Mapping: Define fields like category, account_id, and body for filtering.
Key Steps:

Run Elasticsearch in a Docker container.

Create an Elasticsearch index with optimized mappings.

Build a search API endpoint that accepts keywords and filters (e.g., "Show only ‘Interested’ emails from Account A").

Phase 4: AI-Powered Categorization (4 Hours)
Objective: Automatically tag emails using Qroq.
Tools & Purpose:

Qroq API: Processes email text to assign labels (e.g., "Spam").

Prompt Engineering: Design a strict prompt to force Qroq to return only the 5 allowed categories.
Key Steps:

Extract plain text from emails (strip HTML/CSS).

Send email text to Qroq’s API with your classification prompt.

Store the AI-generated label in Elasticsearch.

Trigger Slack/webhook alerts for "Interested" emails.

Phase 5: Frontend Development (6 Hours)
Objective: Build a user-friendly interface for email management.
Tools & Purpose:

React: Creates dynamic UI components (email list, search bar).

Axios: Connects frontend to FastAPI endpoints.

Material-UI: Pre-designed components (buttons, filters) for speed.
Key Features:

Email List View: Displays sender, subject, and AI labels.

Search & Filters: Lets users search by keyword or filter by account/category.

Email Preview Panel: Shows full email content and AI reply suggestions.

Phase 6: AI-Powered Suggested Replies (5 Hours)
Objective: Suggest context-aware replies using Qroq and RAG.
Tools & Purpose:

Qroq Embeddings API: Converts your product/outreach data into vectors.

FAISS/Chroma: Stores vectors for quick similarity searches.
Workflow:

Preload your outreach agenda (e.g., "Share meeting link if interested") into a vector database.

When an email arrives, search the vector DB for relevant context.

Combine the email text + context in a Qroq API prompt to generate replies.

Phase 7: Testing & Deployment (3 Hours)
Objective: Ensure stability and deploy for submission.
Key Tasks:

Testing:

Validate real-time sync across 2 accounts.

Test Slack alerts for "Interested" emails.

Verify reply suggestions match your outreach agenda.

Deployment:

Use Docker Compose to bundle Elasticsearch + backend.

Deploy frontend to Netlify/Vercel for public access.

Tool-to-Feature Mapping
Feature Tools Involved Purpose
Real-Time Sync aioimaplib, IMAP IDLE Live email updates
Search Elasticsearch, Docker Fast search/filtering
AI Labels Qroq API, FastAPI Automate categorization
Slack Alerts Slack Webhooks, Python Notify urgent emails
Suggested Replies Qroq Embeddings, FAISS Context-aware AI replies
Prioritization for 24-Hour Submission
Must-Have (Day 1):

Real-time sync for 2 accounts.

Basic Elasticsearch search.

Qroq categorization (even if basic).

Minimal frontend showing emails.

Nice-to-Have (If Time):

Slack/webhook alerts.

Suggested replies.

Key Takeaways
Start with IMAP Sync: This is the backbone of the project.

Mock AI Responses Early: Use dummy categories if Qroq setup takes time.

Frontend Last: Build it after the backend APIs are tested with Postman.
